# What is Web Scraping? Why is it Used? Give three areas where Web Scraping is used to get data.

# Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites using automated tools or scripts. It involves collecting data
# from HTML pages, parsing it, and then storing it in a structured format, such as a database or a spreadsheet.
# 
# Web scraping is used for a variety of purposes, such as data mining, market research, competitor analysis, and content
# aggregation. It can also be used to automate tasks that would otherwise be time-consuming, such as extracting product 
# information from e-commerce websites or gathering news articles from different sources.
# 
# 
# E-commerce: Web scraping can be used to extract product information, prices, and reviews from e-commerce websites. 
#     This data can then be used for market research and price comparison, as well as to create price tracking and monitoring
#     tools.
# 
# Finance: Web scraping can be used to extract financial data, such as stock prices, market trends, and economic indicators. 
#     This data can then be used for investment analysis, risk management, and trading strategies.
# 
# Content aggregation: Web scraping can be used to gather news articles, blog posts, and other content from different sources 
#     and present them in a single location, such as a news aggregator or a content management system. This can be useful for 
#     creating curated content or for monitoring specific topics or keywords across multiple websites.

# What are the different methods used for Web Scraping?

# Parsing HTML: This is the most basic method of web scraping, where the HTML source code of a webpage is downloaded and 
#     parsed using a programming language like Python. The data is then extracted by navigating through the HTML tree using 
#     the Document Object Model (DOM) structure.
# 
# Using APIs: Many websites provide APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow developers to access and extract data 
#     from the website's database directly. APIs can be used to extract data in a structured format, such as JSON or XML.
# 
# Web Scraping Tools: There are many web scraping tools available that can be used to extract data from websites. These tools 
#     usually work by automating the process of navigating through the website and extracting data using pre-defined rules.
# 
# Headless Browsers: Headless browsers like Selenium or Puppeteer can be used to automate web browsing and data extraction. 
#     These tools simulate the behavior of a real browser and can navigate through websites, fill out forms, and extract data.

# What is Beautiful Soup? Why is it used?

# Beautiful Soup is a Python library that is used for web scraping purposes. It provides a set of tools for parsing HTML and 
# XML documents, extracting information from them, and manipulating their contents. Beautiful Soup makes it easy to navigate 
# and search through HTML documents and extract specific pieces of data.
# 
# Extracting data from websites: Beautiful Soup can be used to extract data from websites for research, analysis, and other 
#     purposes. It can extract data such as product information, news articles, and social media posts.
# 
# Web automation: Beautiful Soup can be used to automate web-related tasks such as form submission, navigating through pages, 
#     and clicking on links.
# 
# Data analysis: Beautiful Soup can be used to extract data from HTML and XML documents, which can then be analyzed and
#     visualized using data analysis libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib.

# Why is flask used in this Web Scraping project?

# The Flask web application provides a simple and user-friendly interface for the user to input the URL of the website to 
# scrape and the type of data to extract. The application then uses Beautiful Soup and other web scraping tools to extract 
# the requested data from the website and display it to the user in a structured format.
# 
# Flask is used in this project because it is well-suited for small to medium-sized web applications and provides a wide 
# range of tools and extensions that make it easy to develop and deploy web applications. Additionally, Flask is highly 
# customizable, which means that it can be adapted to suit the specific requirements of the web scraping project, such as 
# handling user authentication and managing web scraping jobs. Overall, Flask provides a solid foundation for building a 
# web scraping application and makes it easy to create a user-friendly interface for managing and displaying web scraped data.

# Write the names of AWS services used in this project. Also, explain the use of each service.

# AWS Lambda: AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that is used to run code without provisioning or managing servers. 
#     In this project, AWS Lambda is used to host the web scraping code that is written in Python. The Lambda function is 
#     triggered by an HTTP request and returns the scraped data in JSON format.
# 
# Amazon API Gateway: Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that is used to create, deploy, and manage APIs for 
#     applications running on AWS. In this project, Amazon API Gateway is used to create a RESTful API endpoint that triggers 
#     the Lambda function when a request is made to the API. The API Gateway is also used to manage access control and request 
#     throttling.
# 
# Amazon S3: Amazon S3 is a highly scalable and durable object storage service that is used to store and retrieve data. In 
#     this project, Amazon S3 is used to store the scraped data that is returned by the Lambda function. The data is stored 
#     in JSON format and can be retrieved and analyzed later.
# 
# AWS CloudFormation: AWS CloudFormation is a service that is used to automate the creation and management of AWS resources. 
#     In this project, AWS CloudFormation is used to create and deploy the Lambda function and API Gateway as a single stack.
