# What is Min-Max scaling, and how is it used in data preprocessing? Provide an example to illustrate its
# application.

# Min-Max scaling is a data preprocessing technique that scales numerical data to a fixed range, usually between 0 and 1. The technique preserves the relative differences between the data points while bringing them to a common scale.
# 
# Consider a dataset of house prices, where the prices range from $50,000 to $1,000,000, and the sizes range from 500 to 5000 square feet. The dataset also contains a binary variable indicating whether the house has a garage or not.
# 
# To apply Min-Max scaling to the dataset, we first need to identify the minimum and maximum values for each variable. The minimum and maximum values for the price variable are $50,000 and $1,000,000, respectively. The minimum and maximum values for the size variable are 500 and 5000, respectively.
# 
# To scale the price variable to a range between 0 and 1, we use the formula:

# price_scaled = (price - 50,000) / (1,000,000 - 50,000)
# #For example, if a house has a price of $500,000, its scaled value would be:
# 
# price_scaled = (500,000 - 50,000) / (1,000,000 - 50,000) = 0.4444
# #To scale the size variable to a range between 0 and 1, we use the formula:
# 
# size_scaled = (size - 500) / (5000 - 500)
# #For example, if a house has a size of 2000 square feet, its scaled value would be:
# 
# size_scaled = (2000 - 500) / (5000 - 500) = 0.3667
# #The binary variable indicating whether the house has a garage or not does not need to be scaled since it is already in a binary format.

# What is the Unit Vector technique in feature scaling, and how does it differ from Min-Max scaling?
# Provide an example to illustrate its application.

# The Unit Vector technique, also known as normalization, is a feature scaling technique that scales the data such that each sample has a Euclidean norm of 1. The technique rescales the features so that they have a unit vector length without changing the direction of the data. This can be useful when the magnitude of the feature values is not as important as their direction.
# 
# An example of applying the Unit Vector technique can be illustrated with a dataset of two variables, x and y, where x represents the age of a person, and y represents their income. The dataset contains three samples
# 
# Sample 1: (x=30, y=50000)
# Sample 2: (x=40, y=60000)
# Sample 3: (x=50, y=70000)
# ||Sample 1|| = sqrt(30^2 + 50000^2) = 50000.25
# x_normalized = 30 / 50000.25 = 0.0006
# y_normalized = 50000 / 50000.25 = 0.99999
# 
# After scaling all the samples, the dataset would look like:
# 
# Sample 1: (x_normalized=0.0006, y_normalized=0.99999)
# Sample 2: (x_normalized=0.0007, y_normalized=0.99999)
# Sample 3: (x_normalized=0.0007, y_normalized=0.99999)
# 

# What is PCA (Principle Component Analysis), and how is it used in dimensionality reduction? Provide an
# example to illustrate its application.

# PCA can be used to identify patterns in the data, reduce the number of features, and identify the most significant features in the data. It is widely used in various fields, including image processing, finance, genetics, and many others.
# 
# The basic steps for performing PCA are as follows:
# 
# Standardize the data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.
# Calculate the covariance matrix of the standardized data.
# Calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix.
# Sort the eigenvectors by their corresponding eigenvalues, which represent the amount of variance they explain.
# Select the top k eigenvectors with the highest eigenvalues, where k is the number of dimensions we want to reduce the data to.
# Project the data onto the k eigenvectors to obtain the new reduced-dimensional dataset.

# What is the relationship between PCA and Feature Extraction, and how can PCA be used for Feature
# Extraction? Provide an example to illustrate this concept.

# PCA and feature extraction are closely related. In fact, PCA is often used as a feature extraction technique, where it extracts a set of new features (principal components) from the original set of features, such that the new features capture the most important information in the original features.
# 
# Feature extraction is a process of transforming a set of original features into a new set of features that are more informative and can better represent the data. PCA is a popular feature extraction technique, where it transforms the original features into a set of principal components, which are linear combinations of the original features.
# 
# The principal components are selected such that they capture the maximum variance in the original data. The first principal component represents the direction in which the data varies the most, while the second principal component represents the direction in which the data varies the second-most, and so on.

# You are working on a project to build a recommendation system for a food delivery service. The dataset
# contains features such as price, rating, and delivery time. Explain how you would use Min-Max scaling to
# preprocess the data.

# To use Min-Max scaling in the food delivery recommendation system project, we would first select the relevant features from the dataset, such as price, rating, and delivery time. Then, we would apply Min-Max scaling to these features by following the steps below:
# 
# Find the minimum and maximum values of each feature. For example, the minimum and maximum prices of the food items in the dataset.
# 
# Scale the values of each feature to a range between 0 and 1 using the following formula:
# 
# scaled_value = (value - min_value) / (max_value - min_value)
# 
# For example, if the minimum price is $5 and the maximum price is $20, the scaled value for a food item with a price of $10 would be:
# 
# scaled_value = ($10 - $5) / ($20 - $5) = 0.375
# 
# Repeat step 2 for all the values of each feature.

# You are working on a project to build a model to predict stock prices. The dataset contains many
# features, such as company financial data and market trends. Explain how you would use PCA to reduce the
# dimensionality of the dataset.

# general steps you would follow to use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the stock price dataset:
# 
# Standardize the data: The first step in PCA is to standardize the data by subtracting the mean from each feature and dividing by the standard deviation. This step is important because it ensures that each feature is on the same scale.
# 
# Compute the covariance matrix: The covariance matrix shows the relationship between the different features in the dataset. This is computed by multiplying the transpose of the standardized data matrix by the standardized data matrix itself.
# 
# Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors: The eigenvectors of the covariance matrix represent the principal components of the dataset. The eigenvalues represent the amount of variance explained by each eigenvector. This is computed using a mathematical formula, and the resulting eigenvectors and eigenvalues are used to transform the data.
# 
# Select the principal components: The number of principal components to use is determined by examining the eigenvalues. We can choose the top k eigenvectors with the highest eigenvalues that explain the most variance in the data.
# 
# Transform the data: The selected eigenvectors are then used to transform the data into a lower-dimensional space. The resulting transformed data has a reduced number of dimensions but still captures most of the variation in the original dataset.

# For a dataset containing the following values: [1, 5, 10, 15, 20], perform Min-Max scaling to transform the
# values to a range of -1 to 1.

# To perform Min-Max scaling to transform the values to a range of -1 to 1, we can use the following formula:
# 
# X_scaled = (X - X_min) / (X_max - X_min) * (max_range - min_range) + min_range
# 
# where:
# 
# X is the original value
# X_min is the minimum value in the dataset
# X_max is the maximum value in the dataset
# max_range is the maximum range of the scaled data, which is 1 in this case
# min_range is the minimum range of the scaled data, which is -1 in this case
# 
# X_min = 1
# X_max = 20
# max_range = 1
# min_range = -1
# 
# X_scaled = (X - X_min) / (X_max - X_min) * (max_range - min_range) + min_range
#           = (X - 1) / (20 - 1) * (1 - (-1)) + (-1)
#           = (X - 1) / 19 * 2 - 1
# 

# For a dataset containing the following features: [height, weight, age, gender, blood pressure], perform
# Feature Extraction using PCA. How many principal components would you choose to retain, and why?

# To perform feature extraction using PCA on the given dataset, we would first need to standardize the data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each feature. Then, we would calculate the covariance matrix and obtain the eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The eigenvectors with the highest eigenvalues would represent the principal components, which can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the data.
# 
# The number of principal components to retain would depend on the amount of variance we want to preserve in the data. One way to determine this is by examining the explained variance ratio, which represents the proportion of the total variance in the data that is explained by each principal component. We can plot a scree plot to visualize the explained variance ratio for each principal component and choose the number of components that explain a significant amount of variance in the data.
# 
# Without knowing more about the dataset, it is difficult to determine how many principal components to retain. However, we can make some general assumptions. Since there are only five features in the dataset, we might be able to retain all the principal components (up to a maximum of five). However, if there is a high correlation between some of the features, we might be able to reduce the dimensionality of the data by retaining fewer components.
